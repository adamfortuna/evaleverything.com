eval everything is a blog by [Adam Fortuna][] serving as an outlet for writing about technical topics that many people in my life would be bored reading about on my [personal blog][]. I'm a developer at [Envy Labs][] working on [Code School][] and usually have at least a commit or two in on every course we release.

If you're curious what went into the design and setup of the site, you should checkout the post on [Designing eval everything][], or just [grab the source][].

At Code School, I work mostly on the course side of things. Most of us wear a lot of hats -- sometimes writing courses, sometimes implementing them. My main focus this year has included writing content for some of our JavaScript courses and, more recently, working on course front ends with Backbone.js. We recently revamped it to make it easier to bring new ideas to light. Check out the first level of [Rails 4: Zombie Outlaws][] for an example.

Looking forward, my biggest technological areas of interest are Ember.js, AngularJS, D3, and iOS development. My biggest inspiration is probably [Bret Victor][].

I blog (somewhat rarely) about my life at [adamfortuna.com][]. Any programming or technology related posts will be here on eval everything, but goals, self improvement and more personal posts are on there. For example, my trip to [wwdc][] and my experience with [getting LASIK][].

Recently worked on the front and for Code Schools new [JavaScript Roadtrip][] course. This is the first course where everything happens in the browser rather than sending the code off to be executed somewhere else. Absolutely love the design on it as well.

Earler this year I helped launch Code Schools [Try jQuery][] course. This is a hugely useful free course that we worked with the jQuery team to build. It's available at [try.jquery.com][], and is often one of the first steps people new to jQuery take towards learning the framework.

eval everything is a blog by [Adam Fortuna][] serving as an outlet for writing about technical topics that many people in my life would be bored reading about on my [personal blog][]. I'm a developer at [Envy Labs][] working on [Code School][] and often have at least a commit or two in on every course we release.

If you're curious what went into the design and setup of the site, you should checkout the post on [Designing eval everything][], or just [grab the source][].

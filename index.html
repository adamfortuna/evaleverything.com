          <p>In browser notifications have made a lot of progress in the last few years. Hell, native notifications have made a lot of progress in that time too. Just a few years ago, everyone on the Mac was using <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a>. With the release of Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) the one purpose of Growl was now built in and everyone I know made the switch to using native notifications.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Warning: Link to the official spec.</p>
</div>


<p>Notifications caught on with Mac App developers. <a href="http://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/">HTML 5 Notifications</a> have had a slower growth curve as the various browsers focus in on a single standard. As of this writing, here&rsquo;s a recap of where the different browsers stand when it comes to supporting notifications.</p>

<p>OS X Mavericks has expanded support for notifications that builds heavily on this. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s public on the topic so far:</p>

<blockquote><p>Once users have signed up for notifications from your website in Safari, you can send them push notifications that appear just like app notifications, even when Safari isn’t running. Users can then click on your push notification to launch your website.</p><footer><small>OS X Mavericks for Developers</small> <cite><a href='https://developer.apple.com/osx/whats-new/'>developer.apple.com/osx/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>In other words, it&rsquo;s time to hop on board the notification train if you want another route of reaching your sites visitors. Let&rsquo;s check out how this applies to the different browsers.</p>

<h2>Common Traits</h2>

<div class='pull-right raw '><p>Read the source from this project to understand how browsers implement notifications</p>
</div>


<p>The major browsers (setting aside IE) have a few patterns in common right now that we can use to style our behavior pattern around. If you want see how to use notifications in different browsers, check out the <a href="https://github.com/ttsvetko/HTML5-Desktop-Notifications/">HTML5 Desktop Notifications</a> project on GitHub. It&rsquo;s worth reading over the source code.</p>

<h2>Request Permission</h2>

<p>In order to send notifications in all browsers, you&rsquo;ll need to request permission to do so. In that very long spec, there are 3 permission levels noted:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>default</code> &ndash; No permission granted or denied</li>
<li><code>granted</code> &ndash; The user has granted permission to send notifications</li>
<li><code>denied</code> &ndash; The user has denied permission</li>
</ul>


<p>If permission is denied you won&rsquo;t be able to request permission again in the current session. If you try to send a notification without having been granted permission, nothing will happen.</p>

<h2>Send A Message</h2>

<p>Once you have permission, you&rsquo;ll be able send down a notification with the following attributes:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>title</code> &ndash; Should be short and to the point</li>
<li><code>body</code> &ndash; You&rsquo;ll have a bit more room to work with here. Unfortunately, in Safari this will be truncated</li>
<li><code>icon</code> &ndash; In Chrome and Firefox, you can send over whatever icon you want. This isn&rsquo;t being served by Notification Center, so there is more flexibility here.</li>
</ul>


<p>When the message is shown, there are also a few events that we can tie into for added flexibility:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>onshow</code> &ndash; When the notification is first shown.</li>
<li><code>onclick</code> &ndash;  When the user clicks on the notification. By default this will bring the window into focus.</li>
<li><code>onclose</code> &ndash; When the notification is closed, either by the user or programatically.</li>
<li><code>onerror</code> &ndash; Trigger if the notification cannot be presented to the user</li>
</ul>


<p>Here&rsquo;s a few examples of how these notifications look in different browsers.</p>

<div class='pull-left '><p><img src="/images/icons/safari.png" alt="Safari" class="icon" /></p>
</div>


<h3>Safari</h3>

<p>For Safari notifications, you won&rsquo;t be able to provide an icon unfortunately. Instead it&rsquo;ll always use the Safari icon. It will also show the hostname where the notification came from though, which is unique to Safari.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/native-javascript-notifications/safari-notification-small.png" alt="Safari Notification" /></p>

<p>One of the nice parts of this notification is that it will sync up with your other notifications. For instance, if you have one notification from Xcode and another from a website, they&rsquo;ll show up stacked rather than on top of each other.</p>

<h3>Mavericks</h3>

<p>Not exactly a JavaScript implementation, but worth noting that notifications in Mavericks behave much differently than HTML 5 notifications. They more closely resemble iOS notifications, where you&rsquo;re pushing to Apple&rsquo;s servers, and they&rsquo;re pushing to the end user.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/native-javascript-notifications/mavericks-notification-small.png" alt="Mavericks Notification" /></p>

<p>The addition of a custom icon here is definitely a plus. This alert is from a <a href="http://kandutech.net/">Safari Push Notification Demo</a> which should only work if you&rsquo;re running Safari in Mavericks. If you clicked on that alert, you&rsquo;d get taken to a page that describes how it works:</p>

<blockquote><p>When you allowed this website to send you push notifications, we generated a 4 digit code and put it in a database along with your Mac&#8217;s push token. When a push notification is triggered through our servers, we resolve the 4 digit code to your Mac&#8217;s token. Once we have your token, we tell Apple&#8217;s servers what the notification should look like, and where it should go. Apple&#8217;s push notification service then delivers the notification we generated to your Mac.</p><footer><small>Safari Push Notification Demo</small> <cite><a href='http://kandutech.net/clicked'>kandutech.net/clicked/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>




<div class='pull-left '><p><img src="/images/icons/chrome.png" alt="Chrome" class="icon" /></p>
</div>


<h3>Chrome</h3>

<p>Chrome notifications show up square, which stands out from the rounded look of OS X and Firefox notifications. It also shows up larger in all dimensions</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Chromes notifications are significantly larger than Notification Center.</p>
</div>


<p><img src="/images/posts/native-javascript-notifications/chrome-notification-small.png" alt="Chrome Notification" /></p>

<p>Unlike Safari notifications, this will stay up until it is dismissed.</p>

<div class='pull-left '><p><img src="/images/icons/firefox.png" alt="Firefox" class="icon" /></p>
</div>


<h3>Firefox</h3>

<p>The Firefox notification would be prettiest out of the box, but the entire body is shown as a link! For all notifications, clicking on it takes you to the page, but Firefox attempts to make it more apparent. The appearance ends up suffering due to this choice.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Why is the body a link Firefox? WHY?</p>
</div>


<p><img src="/images/posts/native-javascript-notifications/firefox-notification-small.png" alt="Firefox Notification" /></p>

<div class='pull-left '><p><img src="/images/icons/ie.png" alt="Chrome" class="icon" /></p>
</div>


<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>While there are no system level notifications in Windows (I don&rsquo;t think?), but Internet Explorer 9 and up allow you to add an icon overlay on the browsers icon. This allows for some feedback in this browser. You can see an example of this in the Readme for the <a href="https://github.com/ttsvetko/HTML5-Desktop-Notifications/">HTML5 Desktop Notifications</a> project on GitHub.</p>

<p>Chrome and Firefox on Windows support notifications that behave similar to their Mac counterparts.</p>

          <p>If you&rsquo;re on the fence about updating an older application to use Rails 4, the addition of <code>ActionController::Live</code> might be helpful in making your decision a little easier. It enables keeping a connection open to your server, which can then respond with partial updates with ease. This bridges one of the bigger gaps that causes people to choose <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a> over Rails for projects.</p>

<h2>A Basic Redis Connection</h2>

<div class='pull-right '><p>If you’re looking for an intro, read Aarons post.</p>
</div>


<p>Aaron Patterson wrote a great post about <a href="http://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/07/30/is-it-live.html">Live Streaming in Rails</a>, over a year ago, but the interface is mostly the same today. That post is still a good starting point for <code>ActionController::Live</code>.</p>

<p>I first ran into the subject when working on Code School&rsquo;s <a href="http://rails4.codeschool.com/">Rails 4: Zombie Outlaws</a> course where the last level is all about streaming, with a mention towards the end about using it in cooperation with Redis. The example we show in that</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick recap of what&rsquo;s going on:</p>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;re using <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma">Puma</a> which allows for concurrent connections to the server.</li>
<li>We create a new connection to Redis. This is important because when we call <code>psubscribe</code>, that connection is locked, and can&rsquo;t do anything else.</li>
<li>Use <code>psubscribe</code> to subscribe to all messages for this user by using an expression. Elsewhere in the application, we are <code>publish</code>ing messages to this same channel.</li>
<li>When a message is received, it&rsquo;s passed down to the client. In this case we&rsquo;re passing down JSON.</li>
<li><code>ensure</code> that the <code>redis</code> connection is <code>quit</code> and the response is ended.</li>
</ul>


<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>If you wrote the above code and opened up that action in a browser, it would actually work fine &mdash; until you tried to load the page again. At that point there would be two connections open from the servers standpoint, but only one active. This is due to the fact that the server doesn&rsquo;t know that the client disconnected.</p>

<div class='pull-right code '><p>Good discussion at github/rails on this issue</p>
</div>


<p>That <code>IOError</code> error isn&rsquo;t triggered when the client disconnects as you might expect, but instead when the server attempts to write to the <code>response.stream</code> only to find that it is no longer active. Turns out this is a <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/10989">well discussed problem</a> That leaves us with a few options on how to test if the client has disconnected:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have the server connection timeout every minute or so. (If you&rsquo;re on Heroku, my guess is this will automatically happen)</li>
<li>Ping the client every few seconds to see if they are still there.</li>
</ul>


<h2>A Working Solution</h2>

<p>I ran into a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14268690/actioncontrollerlive-is-it-possible-to-check-if-connection-is-still-alive">StackOverflow</a> post on this exact topic, which lead to <em>a</em> working solution for this.</p>

<div class='pull-left code '><p>This solution follows the “ping” method.</p>

<p>This solution is based on the idea that the server will know the client has disconnected when it attempts to write to it only to find it&rsquo;s now there. In this case we open up two threads &mdash; one that does our Redis subscription, and another that handles making sure the client is still there.</p>

<p>If you know of a better way of doing this, I&rsquo;d love to hear it. Short of using Sinatra, Goliath or another middleware this is the only way I&rsquo;ve found to handle this.</p>

          <p>I&rsquo;m not a designer. My last attempt at design was my <a href="http://blog.adamfortuna.com/">personal blog</a> (<a href="/images/posts/designing-eval-everything/blog-adamfortuna-com.png">screenshot for posterity</a>), which is far from a masterpiece. When starting this blog, I decided it was time to put some of what I&rsquo;ve learned from the design talent at <a href="http://codeschool.com">Code School</a> to use and see if my eye had improved.</p>

<h2>Octopress</h2>

<p>First step was going with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> and by extension <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>. My last blog was on Jekyll, and I was always a little jealous of how easily it looked to get started with Octopress. The default theme also has Sass and Compass integration right away, which helps in getting started.</p>

<p>Rather than starting from the default theme and making tweaks, I everything away and started writing the HTML and Sass from scratch, which is something Octopress makes incredibly easy.</p>

<h2>Sass</h2>

<p>Sass is the language of choice for the designers at Code School. Specifically the sass style syntax, not the scss style. Code School and each course we do uses Sass, which has slowly built up my confidence in the subject.</p>

<p>I dug into the Ruby Sass gem to help build out the technical side of our Sass course, <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass">Assembling Sass</a>, but it wasn&rsquo;t until I went through it and <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/assembling-sass-part-2">Assembling Sass Part 2</a> that I started to feel like some of the gaps in my knowledge were filled in.</p>

<h2>MVCSS</h2>

<p><a href="http://nick-walsh.com/">Nick Walsh</a> and <a href="http://drewbarontini.com/">Drew Barontini</a> put together <a href="http://mvcss.github.io/">MVCSS</a> which we use on all projects through <a href="http://envylabs.com/">Envy Labs</a> and Code School. Here&rsquo;s how they describe MVCSS:</p>

<blockquote><p>MVCSS is a Sass-based CSS architecture for creating predictable and maintainable application style.</p><footer><small>MVCSS</small> <cite><a href='http://mvcss.github.io/'>mvcss.github.io/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>MVCSS is less of framework that you use, and more of a way of organizing your files and markup in a predictable manner. Although I&rsquo;m not following all of the guidelines, the ones I am following do make things easier to maintain.</p>

<h2>Fundamentals of Design</h2>

<p>In early August, Code School released a very different type of course called <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/courses/fundamentals-of-design">Fundamentals of Design</a> taught by <a href="http://timdikun.com">Tim Dikun</a>. This course hammers in 3 specific topics: typography, color and layout. Like most developers (and most people), I can view a design and have a reaction that it&rsquo;s good or off somehow. Usually though, I have no idea why it is off, or what I could do to improve it. That&rsquo;s where this course fit in &mdash; providing a bit of background on the topic.</p>

<div class='pull-right '><p>This site uses the <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans">Droid Sans</a> font.</p>
</div>


<p>For instance, I&rsquo;ve never put much effort into choosing fonts. After going through this course I had a bit more confidence in choosing a font that might better match the content. I settled on <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans">Droid Sans</a>, one of the fonts mentioned in the course, and available for free on Google Fonts. It is apparently a <strong>Humanist Sans Serif</strong> font, which according to the course, is great for government or educational applications (I&rsquo;ll try to stay educational).</p>

<h2>Ruby</h2>

<div class='pull-right '><p>Want to see how these little pullouts are done? <a href="https://github.com/adamfortuna/evaleverything.com/blob/source/plugins/pullside.rb">View the plugin</a>.</p>
</div>


<p>It&rsquo;s not design, but a little ruby goes a long ways to filling in the gaps. It&rsquo;s dead simple to write plugins that will tie into the Markdown templating to add a bit of style if needed, like with the side pullouts used here. There are a bunch of others bundled with Octopress that are all basic Ruby and easy to understand if you want to see how something is formed.</p>

<p>If you need additional power, you can also drop in any other gem. If you need to debug something, you can always slip a <code>binding.pry</code> in and experiment to get the output you desire.</p>

<h2>Twitter Bootstrap</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to mention Twitter Bootstrap to designers and not get an instant groan of pain. I imagine to some of them it&rsquo;s similar to starting up a Rails application using scaffolding, but putting it into production. That being said, it did help me get this site off the ground with some intelligent defaults in place.</p>

<p>For the most part, Bootstrap is used only for the layout at this point. Ideally I&rsquo;ll strip it out some time in the future, but until then it&rsquo;s been an amazing tool to help me get started.</p>

<h2>Write Your First 3 Posts</h2>

<div class='pull-left '><p>Things like this will standout if you design around your content.</p>
</div>


<p>For me it was impossible to know everything I needed from a design standpoint until writing a few posts. I started out with some sample filler text, but quickly realized it was missing a number of features.</p>

<p>After writing these first three posts, each day I&rsquo;d look at it with a new eye and pick out what I saw as the part that needed the most work. Usually I didn&rsquo;t know what I could do at a glance, so it was a matter of experimenting with color, position and typography until it looked right.</p>

<h2>Logo</h2>

<p>The logo at the time of this writing is only a placeholder until getting something else in there. At first glance it&rsquo;s a little too similar to the Internet Explorer icon for my liking.</p>

<h2>Responsive Design</h2>

<p>One of the advantages of using Twitter Bootstrap is the build in responsive design functionality. A lot of this will <em>just work</em> so long as you follow the grid conventions. This is easier said than done &mdash; especially when a number of elements aren&rsquo;t controlled through Bootstrap. Making the footer responsive was as easy as adding a few <code>col-md-3</code>, <code>col-xs-12</code> and <code>col-sm-4</code> classes to various sections.</p>

<p>MVCSS has a super-simple <code>+respond-to</code> mixin that helps in controlling these too. For instance, at lower resolutions, the side panels are no longer shown.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sass'><span class='line'><span class="nd">+respond-to</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">993</span><span class="kt">px</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">max-width</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nc">.pull-left</span><span class="o">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nc">.pull-right</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="na">float</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="no">none</span> <span class="nv">!important</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This will create the <code>@media</code> query needed for this setup. I&rsquo;m sure as I rip out Bootstrap and try to recreate parts on my own, I&rsquo;ll be using this much more.</p>
